About Me
========

![Picture of Suzanne Peters](/images/suzannepeters1.jpg)You are probably preparing for a special time in your life. I want to help you, your family and friends mark that with a special and unique ceremony.

In my twenty years in human services, I've devoted myself to making a positive difference for people, families and the community.

I've been on the front lines, caring for people with disabilities and I've also sat behind the administrator's desk, making social services work.

I've taught college and university students and have researched health-care delivery across Canada and Internationally.

I earned my Developmental Service Worker and Social Service Worker diplomas from Loyalist College of Applied Arts and Technology in Belleville.

Making a new start, going back to school again later in life, I earned a Bachelor of Arts from Trent University in Peterborough, a Master of Arts from York University, and a PhD ABD in Sociology at York University. I teach first, second and third year university sociology for Laurentian University in Barrie at the Georgian College campus including: Introduction to Sociology, Child, Youth, Aging, Health, Justice, Crime and Punishment.

After a long, careful and selective process of screening, volunteer work and training, I've been named a Humanist Officiant by the [Humanist Association of Canada](http://www.humanistcanada.com/). Humanism is a secular, nonreligious, ethical philosophy of life that aims at the full development of every human being. I'm licensed to perform legal marriages by the Province of Ontario.

But across all the work that I've done, I've truly never learned more than I've learned from the people I work with. This is the spirit I want to bring to work for you and for your special time.

With my very best wishes,  
Suzanne Peters Marriage and Ceremony Officiant

_Licensed by the Registrar General under the Marriage Act of the Province of Ontario  
Authorized Officiant of [Humanist Canada](http://www.humanistcanada.com/)._

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Suzanne Peters&nbsp;â€”&nbsp;Humanist Officiant for the Perth</strong></p>

My name is Suzanne Peters. If you are looking for an Officiant (sometimes called ministers, clergy or preachers) to preside over any ceremony I would love to work with you to make a custom celebration with you and your loved ones. From weddings to anniversaries, from child namings to funerals, I will work with you to develop your own unique ceremony that is nonreligious and will reflect who you are.

I am licensed in Ontario to perform marriages, and have much experience in these joyous celebrations. I offer some <a href="http://lifedeservesceremonies.com/photo-gallery/">photos and videos of such ceremonies</a> for you to see. &nbsp;If you would like to know more about <a href="http://lifedeservesceremonies.com/services/">marriages</a>, <a href="http://lifedeservesceremonies.com/services/child-ceremonies/">child ceremonies</a> or <a href="http://lifedeservesceremonies.com/services/milestone-ceremonies/">milestone ceremonies</a>, visit those pages or <a href="http://lifedeservesceremonies.com/contact-me/">contact me</a> for more information. I perform marriages in the Perth area.

I look forward to working with you to make your day not only special, but also unique.

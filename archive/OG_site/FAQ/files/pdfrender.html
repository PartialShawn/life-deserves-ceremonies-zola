			<div class='faq-question  faq-odd odd'>How do I obtain a Marriage License Application
			
			</div>

			<div class='faq-answer  faq-odd odd'>You can apply for a Marriage License no more than three months prior to your wedding date.  The marriage license is valid anywhere in Ontario for three months from the date of purchase.  A Marriage License can be obtained from the clerk of most cities, townships, towns or villages. Check your municipal blue pages or one can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.orgforms.gov.on.ca/eForms/start.do?lang=en" rel="external">Government of Ontario Website</a>.  <br /><br />Either or both of the persons being married must apply in person to the Marriage License Issuer to obtain a license. They will need to bring identification, such as a birth certificate (along with any change of name certificates), current passport, Record of Immigrant Landing or Canadian citizenship card, along with photo identification, for both persons.<br /><br />There is a set fee for purchasing a Marriage License.  Contact your municipal office for the current fee.

			<div class='faq-question  faq-odd odd'>What if I have been divorced?
			
			</div>

			<div class='faq-answer  faq-odd odd'>If one or both members of the couple are divorced, documentation relating to each divorce will be required.  If you live and were divorced in Canada, you must bring the original or court certified copy of the final decree, final judgment or certificate of divorce to your local municipal office when you are purchasing the marriage license.<br /><br />If you live or were divorced outside of Canada, you may be required to submit documents to the provincial government several weeks prior to applying for a license.  Contact your local municipal office for further information or check the Ontario Government Website for additional requirements on <a href="http://www.ontario.ca/en/life_events/married/012202" rel="external">Getting Married in Ontario </a>after a divorce.

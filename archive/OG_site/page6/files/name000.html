I invite you to look through the description of the services and to <a href="../../page1/contact.php" rel="self" title="LDC Contact">contact me</a> if you have any questions.  </div><div class="flexiblelist-item"><div class="flexiblelist-item-name" <span id="name000">Weddings</span></div><div class="flexiblelist-item-content">Types of Wedding Ceremonies:<br />As a Humanist Officiant, I specialize in the one essential part of the whole that I've been trained and licensed to do: perform and preside over the marriage ceremony, or the ceremonial stage of any event that we gather to mark. I do this with the most personal care and attention.<br /><br />I can marry you in as many ways as two people can be married and will do my best to help you create a specialized ceremony that is personalized in every way.  I can perform small or large ceremonies and can accommodate based on your needs.  You choose your own special time, place and style. I can also help with the proceedings of the wedding by greeting people, soothing nerves, leading the service, introducing participants and talk about what I've learned about  life and marriage and the road ahead. <br /><br /><br />Planning Process:<br />The process of planning a wedding involves many elements to consider.  My primary objective is to support you in planning the perfect ceremony for your special day.  To do this I am available for consultation by email or phone at any time leading up to the ceremony. I also like to provide support in person and will be available for two consultations throughout the planning process. Through our meetings I hope to get a sense of who you are and the traditions that you hold dear.  We can draw on the greatest traditions of your families and their cultures and create a special new tradition that belongs to you.  Together we can create a truly personalized ceremony that you will always remember.  <br /><br />Legal Elements:<br />As your officiant I'm licensed to perform legal marriages in the Provice of Ontario and the services I perform are secular and non-religious in nature.  I can also help you with all legal documentation required by the Province to make sure that you can focus on the intricacies of your special day.  </div><div class="flexiblelist-toc-backlink"><a href="../index.html#toc_page6">Back to Services</a></div></div><div class="contentHeader"></div>
